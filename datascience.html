At the core is data. Troves of raw information, streaming in and stored in enterprise data warehouses. Much to learn by mining it. Advanced capabilities we can build with it. Data science is ultimately about using this data in creative ways to generate business value: .

                    This aspect of data science is all about uncovering findings from data. Diving in at a granular level to mine and understand complex behaviors, trends, and inferences. It's about surfacing hidden insight that can help enable companies to make smarter business decisions. For example:

Netflix data mines movie viewing patterns to understand what drives user interest, and uses that to make decisions on which Netflix original series to produce.
Target identifies what are major customer segments within it's base and the unique shopping behaviors within those segments, which helps to guide messaging to different market audiences.
                      <b class = "bold1">Proctor &amp; Gamble</b> utilizes time series models to more clearly understand future demand, which help plan for production levels more optimally.
How do data scientists mine out insights? It starts with data exploration. When given a challenging question, data scientists become detectives. They investigate leads and try to understand pattern or characteristics within the data. This requires a big dose of analytical creativity.

Then as needed, data scientists may apply quantitative technique in order to get a level deeper â€“ e.g. inferential models, segmentation analysis, time series forecasting, synthetic control experiments, etc. The intent is to scientifically piece together a forensic view of what the data is really saying.

This data-driven insight is central to providing strategic guidance. In this sense, data scientists act as consultants, guiding business stakeholders on how to act on findings.</p>
<p class = "grey-color2">
The main advantage of enlisting data science in an organization is the empowerment and facilitation of decision-making. Organizations with data scientists can factor in quantifiable, data-based evidence into their business decisions. <b class = "bold-1">These data-driven decisions</b> can ultimately lead to increased profitability and improved operational efficiency, business performance and workflows. In customer-facing organizations, data science helps identify and refine target audiences. Data science can also assist recruitment: <b class = "bold-1">Internal processing of applications and data-driven aptitude tests and games</b> can help an organization's human resources team make quicker and more accurate selections during the hiring process</p>
